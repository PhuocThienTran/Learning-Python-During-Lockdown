# Learning-Python-During-Lockdown
During the Covid-19 Pandemic, I found two useful Python resources, that I can self-learn to help prepare for future university courses and potential professional careers. They are as follow:
## Asabeneh's 30 Days of Python Programming Challenge:
  30 days of Python programming challenge is a step by step guide to learn the Python programming language in 30 days. 
## Dr. Charles R. Severance's Python for Everybody:
  The goal of this book is to provide an Informatics-oriented introduction to programming. The primary difference between a computer science approach and the Informatics approach taken in this book is a greater focus on using Python to solve data analysis problems common in the world of Informatics.
